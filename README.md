# VirtualSoc
Required packages:

numpy, pandas, scipy, SALib, pathos 

cupy and CUDA for the GPU version. 

For a single network simulation follow the ScriptSingleNetwork.py  
For multiple networks simulation follow the ScriptMultiNetwork.py 

If you have an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA, use the GPU branch, otherwise the CPU branch

Thanks and happy simulation. 

p.p. The paper will be linked soon.
