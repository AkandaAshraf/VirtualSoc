Required packages:

numpy, pandas, scipy, SALib, pathos 

cupy and CUDA for the GPU version. 

For a single network simulation follow the ScriptSingleNetwork.py  
For multiple networks simulation follow the ScriptMultiNetwork.py 

If you have an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA, use the 

#GPU branch, 

otherwise the # CPU branch

(i.e. not the Master and ignore the other branches for now) 

Thanks and happy simulation. 

p.s. The paper will be linked soon.
